        <h2>QUIZ</h2>
        <p>HTML - The HTML used for the quiz were different divs for the containers and buttons for the answer prompts and the progressing (next button and restart button) prompts</p>
        <p>CSS - Flexbox was used to align the containers properly, CSS Grid was used to make the responsive answer buttons</p>
        <p>JS - Each question was stored in a data structure within the same JS file with the question index, answers, correct answer and the question. JS was used to evaluate the answers by iterating throughout the list of 4 answer options and seeing if the clicked one was equal to the correct answer given in the data structure. The Timer was also made using JS with the setInterval() function.</p>
